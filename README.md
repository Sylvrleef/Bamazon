When a customer starts this program it will give them a list of items for sale. It lists the item id, the item, and the price for the item. The program then asks the customer what they would like to buy. The customer enters the item id for what they want to buy. The program then asks how many the customer would like. If the customer enters a quantity that is higher then what is in stock the program tells them that there is insufficient stock and asks them how many they want again. It will continue doing this until the customer enters a quantity that is available. When the customer does enter a quantity that is available the program then tells them how much they owe. At the same time the program removes that amount from the quantity in stock for that item.
